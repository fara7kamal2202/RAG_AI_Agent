## Project Overview  
This repository enables the creation of an AI Agent that uses the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methodology: retrieving relevant documents/information from a knowledge base, and then generating responses using that retrieved context. The goal is to improve answer accuracy, reduce hallucinations, and tailor responses based on external content.

## Features  
- Connects to a knowledge base  
- Retrieves relevant context given a query.  
- Utilizes a language model to generate responses conditioned on retrieved content.  

## Getting Started  
### Prerequisites  
- an OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
